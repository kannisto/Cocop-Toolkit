# COCOP Message Logger

This application logs message traffic in an AMQP message bus. The messages are
stored in the hard disk, and related metadata enables the user to search for
logged messages. Any messages can be logged, and certain message types can be
visualised in a treeview. These types are the ones commonly exchanged in COCOP
project.
