# Process data simulator service for AMQP

The purpose of this application is to read data from CSV files with one
software process and push this data to AMQP message bus with another process.
The motivation stems from "simulating" the data flow in an industrial process
plant, where current measurement values a published to the message bus
regularly.

The application can be operated remotely over network. It has a Rest
(Representative State Transfer) interface implemented with JSON over HTTP.
The data is served in a standard-based message format.
